Let's (re-re-re-)try Scheme, using the Advent of Code.

Scheme: chibi-scheme (https://synthcode.com/scheme/chibi/)
IDE: emacs using geiser (https://www.nongnu.org/geiser/)
  & magit/forge (https://magit.vc/manual/forge/index.html)

Furthermore, this README shall be my journal.

1·XII·2024 — Initial commit
This year, I would like to enjoy the AoC without any burden, therefore
I shall set no completion objective.
I chose Scheme without much thought, it's just the language with which
I spontaneously wanted to play.

2·XII·2024 — Set up
I need a refresher on magit, would like to try forge with github,
also needs a refresher on chibi-scheme & to learn more about snow.
Lastly, I will try to learn more about geiser than merely switching
from the code file to the REPL.
Completion hangs geiser, I know not why.
chibi-scheme -R starts the smart REPL.
Completion works fine in my terminal, but neither in geiser nor in
eshell.
Scheme is a bare language, I intend to use R7RS (scheme base) along-
side various SRFIs, though I know them not at the moment.
It turns out, geiser doesn't actually play well with chibi-scheme.
I'll now try Alex Shinn's scheme-complete, which he distributes as a
file on his wiki. Add the file to the load-paths.

I actually used the previous commit on github swapping cl for cl-lib.
This all works, but annoyingly I need my terminal to use the REPL
with completion.
